# Week Two

For this weeks task I decided to focus on a really simple musical score I found on the Minecraft game soundtrack. The title of this piece is called "Dry Hands" and is a very noteable piece in the score of the soundtrack. I found the PDF file on a sheet music website that you can find [here](https://sheetmusic-free.com/dry-hands-sheet-music-minecraft/)

After I downloaded the PDF I proceeded to convert it through the musescore programme and it uploaded and developed through the programme well. It processed pretty much identical to the PDF I provided, but I do think this is more to do with the simplicity of the piece as there still was some errors such as missing arpeggiated chords in a few lines. Screenshots of my processed chosen sheet music piece, "Dry Hands" are provided ![here](/images/musescoredryhands.png)
