# Week Two

For this weeks task I decided to focus on a really simple musical score I found on the Minecraft game soundtrack. The title of this piece is called "Dry Hands" and is a very noteable piece in the score of the soundtrack. I found the PDF file on https://sheetmusic-free.com/dry-hands-sheet-music-minecraft/ 

After I downloaded the PDF I proceeded to convert it through the musescore programme and it uploaded and developed through the programme well. It processed pretty much identical to the PDF I provided, but I do think this is more to do with the simplicity
