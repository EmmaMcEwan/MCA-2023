# Week 9 

## Extracting Features 

My chosen theme for this data analytics project was the soundtrack for the game Minecraft. In order to allow more room for additional analysis in this task, I also ran through two other tracks from the soundtrack album, C148.

I have prvodied the panes from my analysis via Sonic Visualiser below for each track with the top pane being a spectogram, the middle being a MFCC and the lower being a chromogram.

## TASK TWO

After being put through Sonic Visualiser, the cvs files for the MFCC panes were put through python in order to analyse the differences between the tracks. These are histograms produced from the MFCC panes below:
