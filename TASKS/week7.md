# Week 7: Challenges with Curation

By revisting the metadata used in the tasks within week 5, I started to investigate the isseus surrounding the curation of music analytics and data. In regards to week 5, I have added genre information within the mei file, which in the case of the music file I have been looking into, it is often reffered to as the 'Ambient' genre. I did this by adding the < genre > tag into the header of the MEI file. I also additionally added the rights for the music within the Minecraft Game Soundtrack under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommerical 4.0 International Lisence. You can view the updated file including genre and rights [here](../data/dryhandsgenrerights.mei)
