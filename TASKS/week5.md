## Metadata

### Task One: Creating a Metadata Scheme

The metadata scheme I have chosen to focus on these elements about the metadata:

#### The Metadata in the File:

- The size of the file
- The title of the file
- The length of the audio file
- The type of file
- The source of the file
- The date the file was created

  #### The Metadata Regarding Encoding:

  - Project descriptions
  - Programme used to encode & the encoding language
  - Encoding date and time
  - Edits made to the encoding

     #### The Metadata Regarding The OG Piece:

    - The title of the piece
    - The composer/lyricist of the piece
    - The length of the piece
    - The year it was published
