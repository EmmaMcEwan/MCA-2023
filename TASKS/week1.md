# Week One: Musical Datasets Task

## Task One: Musical Data Theme
The theme I have chosen for my musical data set and project work is the soundtrack in the popular game 'Minecraft'. Created in 2009, Minecraft is a 3D block-like survival game that has many challenges throughout. To me personally, the game is very nostalgic and their use of music is very important throughout to create mood and atmosphere. The music in the game primarily consists of two soundtrack albums by German musican Daniel Rosenfeld. From the Minecraft music wikipedia "The soundtrack's minimalistic and melancholic composition has been praised by critics. Keith Stuart of The Guardian noted that Rosenfeld's "wilting, minimalist tracks, slow-paced and slightly melancholy, recall the ambient works of Satie and Eno", calling it the game's "perfect accompaniment.". As this music is quite familar to me through playing the game I believe this will allow to feel more comfortable with the tasks at hand. 

## Task Two: Metadata Surrounding My Chosen Musical Theme
In terms of datasets related to the 'Minecraft' game soundtrack, the first is recorded music found on streaming platforms. An example of a streaming platform in this context is Spotify. This type of data allows us to listen to the recorded tracks of music, organised into albums, and hear how it is supposed to sound according to the creator. It also provides the listener with more specific data such as the duration of the songs, the timing, lyrics etc. Streaming services also provide us with some metadata such as the amount of listens on each song and the details about the creators of the songs/albums. With spotify, they gather your activity data and even reccommend you similar music you may enjoy based on the data they collect. 

Another data source for music is notated sheet music data. Sheet music can be physically hand written data or digitally sotred online in a photopgraphic format. Photos of sheet music can even be scanned through softwares in order to convert it to a digital, downloadable file format.

## Task Three: Challenges faced
Some challenges I faced with this starting off was that I struggled to find the sheet music I wanted tp focus on and had to use specific searching measures such as keywords and filtering processes. Thanks to these abilities on the musescore website, I was able to find my chosen sheet music file but it was harder than I anticipated.
