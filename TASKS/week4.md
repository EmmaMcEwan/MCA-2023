 # Week 4: jSymbolic and music21

## Task One: jSymbolic
By using jSymbolic, I was able to generate an analysis on my piece on specific chosen aspects. The aspects I chose to focus on and their data results were:

| jSymbolic Aspect   | Data Result |
| -------- | ------- |
| No. of Pitches | 21    |
| No. of Pitch Classes | 6     |
| Range    | 41    |
| Strong Tonal Centres | 2   |
| Mean Pitch | 59    |
| Mean Pitch Class   | 5.608  |
| Most Common Pitch | 69  |
| Most Common Pitch Class | 1    |
| Interval Between Most Prevalent Pitches   | 3  |
| Pitch Variability | 11.94   |
| Most Common Melodic Interval | 2    |


In terms of pitch class histograms, there were several:

| Pitch Class Histogram No.  | Data Result |
| -------- | -------- |
| 0  | 0.191  |
| 1  | 0.1206 |
| 2  | 0      |
| 3  |  0.1759|
| 4  | 0      |
| 5  | 0.1709 |
| 6  | 0      |
| 7  | 0      |
| 8  | 0.1558 |
| 9  | 0      |
| 10 | 0.1859 |
| 11 | 0      |

Extracting basic aspects of the file data such as number of pitches, number of pitch classes, mean pitch, pitch class helps to analyse the basic makeup of the notation file. 
The other aspects leaned more into a deeper delve into the specifics of the music data. 
These include pitch variability, intervals between prevalent pitches, most common melodic interval, etc. 
You can access the jSymbolic extracted data in the cvs file [here](../data/ACEXMLFVSP.csv)
